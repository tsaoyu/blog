## First assignment  
The first time I knew pinhole photography was back in junior high school. 
It was an assignment from the Physics class, we were asked to build a camera using the pinhole effect.
The design was simple Pringles cam with a tiny hole on the metal end.
The other side was covered by a piece of semi-transparent paper. 
As light went through the pinhole and projected on the paper, producing an up-side-down image.
The blurry image of I first saw have being in my head since then. 

## 10 years after  
The way we take photos changed so rapidly during the last ten years. The Kodak Express film development shop, feels like in a night, all disappeared from the high street.
The compact digital camera rise and fall. Smartphones now taking the first place as the most popular {% sidenote 'one' 'Observation based on [Most Popular Cameras](https://www.flickr.com/cameras/) in flickr user community'%} photography devices. Even before I saved enough money for a entry level DSLR, the mirrorless camera already change the way we understand professional photography.

It would be interesting to take photos using the pinhole plus latest technology so I could digitalise those images as much as possible.  
And here is how it looks like:

*Here is it!* Seagulls and People, a pretend-to-be 1960s photo taken a mirrorless camera. The camera use the exact same pinhole principle as my Pringles cam. 
The only difference is the now has a digital back so I could share the image with you.
Judging by the standard of modern photography, it was horrible.
The sharpness definitely wasn't on a par with images produced by modern lens. 
However, the blurry and unsaturated flavour makes it creamy and even dreamy. 
I guess that is the reason why it is accepted as an alternative photography. 

## Engineering a pinhole
You could drill a hole on the body cap to get your first pinhole len.
