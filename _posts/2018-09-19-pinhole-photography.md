The first time I had an experiment on pinhole photography is when I was in junior high school. The assignment of an optics lesson in Physics is to make a simple pinhole camera. A solution I had was an empty Pringles can with a tiny hole drilled at the bottom and the cut the top with a piece of semi-transparent paper. When I bring that 'camera' to the office of my Physics teacher, we use it to 'film' the building not far away through the window, it was really exciting to see an up-side-down blurring image. I forget what was the comment on my little gadget but that image remains in my head for long. 


Since then the way we take photo changed so rapidly. Feels like all in a night, the Kodak express film development shop was disappeared. Portable digital cameras come and go. Smartphones takes up from 2 Mega-pixels to dual camera system. It was the visit to the Norwegian Photography Museum that motivate me to pick up the missing part years in photography. After a bit research, I picked up a Sony A7 II mirrorless camera that was the most affordable full frame digital camera on the market. So I get through the course content few chapters on [Digital & Computational Photography] [http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp07/6.088/]offered as MIT 6.088 to educate myself. It was mind blowing for me that was so many things happened after you press the shutter button and get your Photoshoped version out. My photography skill slowly improved but far from perfect in artistic perspective of view. But I am happy since my friends do like () the work I have done. But my understanding on photography was somehow still stuck at the pinhole phenomena.  So, I decide to try something with pinhole again. 

The first idea is to simply drill a pinhole on the body lens cap. The question comes to what is the size of the pinhole for the camera.
