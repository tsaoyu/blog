## First assignment  
The first time I knew pinhole photography was back in junior high school. 
It was an assignment from the Physcis class, we were asked to build a 'camera' using the pinhole effect.
The design I had was simple: an half-cutted Pringles can with a tiny hole at the bottom, the open end covered by a piece of semi-transparent paper. As light went through the pinhole and projected on the paper, an blurry image appeared on the side with transparent paper. I don't recall what was the comments but the up-side-down blurry image I saw have being in my head since then. 

## 10 years after 
But strictly it wasn't pinhole photography, the important part in taking photo haven't done yet. After 10 years, I started to find a way to take a real photo using the pinhole effect. The way we take photos changed so rapidly during the last ten years. The Kodak Express film development shop, feels like in a night, all disappeared from the high street. The portable digital camera market rise and fall. Smartphones now taking the first place as the most popular {% sidenote 'one' 'Observation based on [Most Popular Cameras](https://www.flickr.com/cameras/) in flickr user commnutiy'%} photography devices. Even before I save enough money for a entry level DSLR, the mirrorless camera already change the way we understand professional photography. And finally I made few photos using a 3D printed pinhole len with a mirrorless digital camera:

*Here is it!* Seagulls and People, a fresh photo that is taken as if it was 1960s. The camera use the exact same pinhole principle as my Pringles cam, the only difference is the light is recorded by digtal sensor. In the era when everyone talking about the sharpness of the photo, this soft image definitely wasn't on a par with modern lens. But the blurry edge and unsaturated color gives a very special creamy and dreamy taste. I would argue this is a piece of art and more importantly this marks the finish of the assignment I had ten years ago. In the remainder of this articile, I will explain why I decided to use a 3D printed pinhole len, how pinhole photography different from normal photogrphy, and what can you expect if you plan to build one as well.  

## First attempt
The first attempt was even simpler than my Pringles camera:

And the quality was okay-ish.
