## First assignment  
The first impression I had on pinhole photography was back in junior high school. 
It was an assignment from the Physcis class, we are asked to build a 'camera' using the pinhole effect.
The design I had was pretty simple, an half-cutted Pringles can with a tiny hole at the bottom and the open end covered by a piece of semi-transparent paper. I don't recall what was the comments but the up-side-down blurry image I saw have being in my head since then. 

## 10 years after 
During the last ten years, the way we take photos changed so rapidly. The Kodak Express film development shop, feels like in a night, all disappeared from the high street. The portable digital camera market rise and fall and the smartphones are now the most popular photography devices. However, I always the assignment haven't finish yet.

Smartphones takes up from 2 Mega-pixels to dual camera system. It was the visit to the Norwegian Photography Museum that motivate me to pick up the missing part years in photography. After a bit research, I picked up a Sony A7 II mirrorless camera that was the most affordable full frame digital camera on the market. So I get through the course content few chapters on

[Digital & Computational Photography](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp07/6.088/) offered as MIT 6.088 to educate myself. It was mind blowing for me that was so many things happened after you press the shutter button and get your Photoshoped version out. My photography skill slowly improved but far from perfect in artistic perspective of view. But I am happy since my friends do like () the work I have done. But my understanding on photography was somehow still stuck at the pinhole phenomena.  So, I decide to try something with pinhole again. 

The first idea is to simply drill a pinhole on the body lens cap. The question comes to what is the size of the pinhole for the camera.
