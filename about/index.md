My blog **博**  (bó) is a collection of articles that have been progressively written for some long-term thoughts.
The name of the blog is the first character that taken from the Chinese phonetic translation of the `blog` (博客). As a single character, it means wide or huge and often linked to process a wide range of knowledge.
